# Style Guide (Bare Description)

## Design System: Modern Structural / Minimalistic

### Visual Language

- Clean, archival, report-like interface
- High contrast, black on white by default
- Strict three-color palette

### Core Rules

#### Color Palette

Use exactly three colors:

- White: primary backgrounds and default surfaces
- Black: primary text, emphasis, and linework
- Light gray: secondary surfaces and inactive states

Light gray is never used for primary text.

#### Borders

- All outlines and separators are thin black lines

#### Prohibited Styles

- No rounded corners
- No shadows
- No gradients

### Typography System

#### Font Families

- Body text uses a neutral sans-serif like helvetica
- Interface controls and labels use a monospaced face
- Do not mix the two within a single element

#### Four-Level Size Hierarchy

Use exactly four text sizes:

- XS: labels and auxiliary information
- SM: body text and descriptions
- LG: section headings
- 2XL: page titles

#### Text Rules

- Labels are uppercase with generous letter spacing
- Headings are bold and can use uppercase for emphasis
- Secondary body text may use reduced contrast

### Layout and Spacing

- Surfaces are simple, flat blocks
- Primary surfaces are white; secondary surfaces are light gray
- Spacing follows a consistent, even grid
- Padding and gaps are uniform across similar elements

### Interaction Behavior

- Interactive controls have clear, consistent outlines
- Hover states increase contrast (often inverted)
- Disabled states use light gray and reduced emphasis
- Focus states remain clearly visible

### Component Philosophy

- Each element carries its own visual identity
- Interactive elements keep fixed, consistent dimensions
- Layout adjustments come from surrounding structure, not from the element itself
